#Instructions

Steps to run locally with eclipse.


1- First make sure to have all libraries for the project install in Eclipse to do so go to 

Open Eclipse > Help > Eclipse Market place

then search for "window builder" in the find search box

make sure to install WindowBuilder 1.9.5 (DO NOT INSTALL  WindowBuilder 1.9.6.pre or any beta version)

once installed, create a new java project "GuessWho".

Once the project is created, open your bash terminal or GitBash for Windows users and navigate to your workspace

  cd "eclipse-default-path-for-workspace/GuessWho/src

once there remove all files 

  rm -r *
  
now clone from GitHub (if you have a ssh key auth set up already):

git clone git@github.com:CarloCapuz/OOPGuessWhoProject.git .

or (for simple https auth) 

git clone https://github.com/CarloCapuz/OOPGuessWhoProject.git . 


Now the project should be all set :)
